<p>As an autobiography,* The Glass Castle* is unusual and impressive to everyone who have ever read it since the author Jeanette Walls’ life experience is abnormal than anyone who can imagine. Her childhood is poor and never sedentary because of her two irresponsible parents. Her father is a talented utopian and reluctant to do any job to burden the responsibility of raising the family. Similarly, her mother is even much weirder, focusing on her painting too much to look after her children. She owns a land that is worth ten thousand pounds but is willing to let her children live in the ghetto without satisfying the basic needs. For many times, the children have been waken up by their parents to get on the car and move to avoid the collectors. As the children grows older, they become tired of this unsettled and poor life style so they leave the family one by one for New York where they pursue the life they wanted and avoid their parents.</p>
<p>Writing this book to some extent is the Jeanette’s way of accepting her parents, embodying their outlook of life and behaviors. His father used her to earn money at the pub in spite of the risk of her being raped. He also steal her money saved for university education… Though her parents are irresponsible and even cruel to her siblings, they do give her beautiful memories. Due to without money to buy the children Christmas gifts, father Rex take each one of them outside to pick one star in the night sky as the Christmas gift. And he told them they are special and no one owns a star as gifts except them. On the way they get away from the collectors, she and Rex hunt the demo in the wild. Although their family life is hard, it is never boring. On the first day when she arrived in New York, the first thing she noticed was that she can’t found the star her father has sent to her because of the pollution. There must be something from her family with her no matter where she goes. And this matters.</p>
<p>Realizing the differences of her parents with common people and understanding their belief is possibly another way to accept her parents. In the class of her college  the professor raised a question that why poor people lead a hard life. The answer she given was criticized by her classmates while she give up arguing with them because she know it’s impossible to take her parents as an example to fight back. This difference and her parents’ belief couldn’t be accepted by others except herself: They just want to live a life like that.</p>
<p>The Glass Castle was once listed on the banned books because of the twisted family relations. This is an irony and miserable fact. Compared with a similar experience of Tara Westover who writes the famous book called Educated. Similar twisted  family relation problems haunted Tara but fortunately she finally finds a relief when she figure out that her father has bipolar disorder. It is this disease breaks her family relations so at least she can at least find an excuse to relieve the pain in her broken heart. In this sense, it's harder for Jeanette Walls to seek a balance in her heart.</p>
<p>The title of the book, <em>The Glass Castle</em>, is a plan of his Jeanette’s father. He wants to build a castle made of glass and put the solar panel on the roof for power supply. She spends much time with her father to plan and had a lot of fun despite the fact that they have never completed it. Actually, I doubt that the plan of building a glass castle is just a tricky her father used to distract their attention elsewhere from the reality. They will never accomplish their design of the glass castle but it’s the process that counts. This can be explained why Jeanette Walls use it as the title as her autobiography memoir. The silver lining she has is wonderful and deserves to cherish. And it dawned on me that it's the sense of security that is as important as security itself. The material satisfaction is cheaper than the accompanying and love.</p>
<p>Many people will pass in our life, and they comes and goes. However, it’s the parents who give us a sense of security and happiness last. They may hurt you by the way they love you and in most cases we will feel and realize this love until the one who gives us the beautiful memories become our memory. It is a happiness that most of us needn't struggle to seek the balance between the behavior of our parents and the fact they are our parents. I wish everyone in this world won't have the state of dismay like that.</p>
